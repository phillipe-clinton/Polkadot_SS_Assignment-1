1. ðŸŒŸ A variable can be used only if it has been initialized.

```rust
question->
/* Fix the error below with least amount of modification to the code
fn main() {
    let x: i32; // Uninitialized but used, ERROR !
    let y: i32; // Uninitialized but also unused, only a Warning !

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    println!("Success!");
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5; 
    let y: i32; 

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    println!("Success!");
}

output-> Success!

modifications-> x = 5, initialized

```
