2. ðŸŒŸ Use mut to mark a variable as mutable.

```rust
question->
/* Fill the blanks in the code to make it compile
fn main() {
    let __ =  1;
    __ += 2; 
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    println!("Success!");
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
    let mut x =  1;
    x += 2; 
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    println!("Success!");
}

output-> Success!

blanks filled->used mut for mutable as used twice here

```
