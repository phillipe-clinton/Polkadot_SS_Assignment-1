```rust
question->
/* Solve it in two ways
// DON'T let `println!` works
fn main() {
    never_return();

    println!("Failed!");
}

fn never_return() -> ! {
    // Implement this function, don't modify the fn signatures
    
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
    never_return();
}

fn never_return() -> ! {
    panic!("What IF")
}

output->
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.32s
     Running `target/debug/playground`
thread 'main' panicked at 'What IF', src/main.rs:6:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

changes-> directly adding panic statement and then we don't need println! statement

```
