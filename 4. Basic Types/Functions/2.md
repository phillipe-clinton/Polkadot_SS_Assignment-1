```rust
question->
/* fn main() {
   print();
}

// Replace i32 with another type
fn print() -> i32 {
   println!("Success!");
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
   print();
}

fn print() -> () {
   println!("Success!");
}

output-> Success!

changes-> replaced i32 with () since its body has no tail or return expression

```
