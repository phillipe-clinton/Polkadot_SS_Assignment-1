```rust
question->
/* fn main() {
    let s = sum(1 , 2);
    assert_eq!(s, 3);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y;
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
    let s = sum(1 , 2);
    assert_eq!(s, 3);
    println!("Success!");
}

fn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}

output-> Success!

changes-> implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression and as a solution remove the semi-colon
