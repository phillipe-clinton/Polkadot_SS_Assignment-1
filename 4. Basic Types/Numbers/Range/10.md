```rust

question->
/* Fill the blanks
use std::ops::{Range, RangeInclusive};
fn main() {
    assert_eq!((1..__), Range{ start: 1, end: 5 });
    assert_eq!((1..__), RangeInclusive::new(1, 5));

    println!("Success!");
} */

solution code->
use std::ops::{Range, RangeInclusive};
fn main() {
    assert_eq!((1..5), Range{ start: 1, end: 5 }); //1
    assert_eq!((1..=5), RangeInclusive::new(1, 5)); //2
    println!("Success!");
}

output-> Success!

blanks filled-> at 1, end is 5 so added 5 there and at 2, range inclusive so added ==5

```
