9. ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ Two goals: 1. Modify assert! to make it work 2. Make println! output: 97 - 122
```rust

question->
/* fn main() {
    let mut sum = 0;
    for i in -3..2 {
        sum += i
    }

    assert!(sum == -3);

    for c in 'a'..='z' {
        println!("{}",c);
    }
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
    let mut sum = 0;
    for i in -3..2 {
        sum += i
    }

    assert!(sum == -5);

    for c in 'a'..='z' {
        println!("{}",c as u8);
    }
}

changes-> since the output c is an unsigned data type we add c as u8.

```
