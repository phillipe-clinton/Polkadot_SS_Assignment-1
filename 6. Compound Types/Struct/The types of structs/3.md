3. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Tuple struct looks similar to tuples, it has added meaning the struct name provides but has no named fields. It's useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name, but don't care about the fields's names.

```rust
question->
/* // Fix the error and fill the blanks
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
fn main() {
    let v = Point(__, __, __);
    check_color(v);

    println!("Success!");
}   

fn check_color(p: Color) {
    let (x, _, _) = p;
    assert_eq!(x, 0);
    assert_eq!(p.1, 127);
    assert_eq!(__, 255);
 } */

solution code->
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
fn main() {
    let v = Point(0, 127, 255);
    check_color(v);
    println!("Success!");
}   

fn check_color(p: Point) {
    let Point(x, _, _) = p;
    assert_eq!(x, 0);
    assert_eq!(p.1, 127);
    assert_eq!(p.2, 255);
}

output-> Success!

modifications-> p.2 to get the point
```
