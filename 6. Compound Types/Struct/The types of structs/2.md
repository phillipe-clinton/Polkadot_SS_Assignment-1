2. 🌟 Unit struct don't have any fields. It can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.

```rust
question->
/* struct Unit;
trait SomeTrait {
    // ...Some behaviors defined here.
}

// We don't care about what fields  are  in the Unit, but we care about its behaviors.
// So we use a struct with no fields and implement some behaviors for it
impl SomeTrait for Unit {  }
fn main() {
    let u = Unit;
    do_something_with_unit(u);

    println!("Success!");
} 

// Fill the blank to make the code work
fn do_something_with_unit(u: __) {   }
*/

solution code->
struct Unit;
trait SomeTrait {
    // ...Some behavours defines here
}

// We don't care the the fields are in Unit, but we care its behaviors.
// So we use a struct with no fields and implement some behaviors for it
impl SomeTrait for Unit {  }
fn main() {
    let u = Unit;
    do_something_with_unit(u);
    println!("Success!");
} 

// fill the blank to make the code work
fn do_something_with_unit(u: Unit) {   }

output-> Success!

blanks filled-> Unit added

```
