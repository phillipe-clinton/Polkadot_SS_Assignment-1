5. ðŸŒŸ Using field init shorthand syntax to reduce repetitions.

```rust
question->
/* Fill the blank
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}
fn main() {
    println!("Success!");
} 

fn build_person(name: String, age: u8) -> Person {
    Person {
        age,
        __
    }
} */

solution code->
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}
fn main() {
    println!("Success!");
} 

fn build_person(name: String, age: u8) -> Person {
    Person {
        age,
        name
    }
}

output: Success!

blanks filled-> name was missing so filled up

```
