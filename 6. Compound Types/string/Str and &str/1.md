1. ğŸŒŸ We can't use str type in normal ways, but we can use &str.
```rust
question->
/* Fix error without adding new line
fn main() {
    let s: str = "hello, world";

    println!("Success!");
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
    let s: &str = "hello, world";
    println!("Success!");
 }

output-> Success!

changes-> &str instead of just str 
```
