6. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ You can only concat a String with &str, and String's ownership can be moved to another variable.

```rust
question->
/* Fix errors without removing any line
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello,");
    let s2 = String::from("world!");
    let s3 = s1 + s2; 
    assert_eq!(s3,"hello,world!");
    println!("{}",s1);
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello,");
    let s2 = String::from("world!");
    let s3 = s1.clone() + &s2; 
    assert_eq!(s3,"hello,world!");
    println!("{}",s1);
}

output-> hello,

modifications-> we clone s1 and concat it with &str

```
