1. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Here, both [i32] and str are slice types, but directly using it will cause errors. You have to use the reference of the slice instead: &[i32], &str.

```rust
question->
/* Fix the errors, DON'T add new lines!
fn main() {
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    let s1: [i32] = arr[0..2];

    let s2: str = "hello, world" as str;

    println!("Success!");
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    let s1: &[i32] = &arr[0..2];

    let s2: &str = "hello, world";
    println!("Success!");
}

output-> Success!

modifications-> using reference of the slice &[i32], &str

```
