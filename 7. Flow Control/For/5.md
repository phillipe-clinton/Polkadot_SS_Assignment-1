```rust
question ->
/* fn main() {
    let a = [4, 3, 2, 1];

    // Iterate the indexing and value in 'a'
    for (i,v) in a.__ {
        println!("The {}th element is {}",i+1,v);
    }
} 
*/

solution code->
fn main() {
    let a = [4, 3, 2, 1];

    // iterate the indexing and value in 'a'
    for (i, v) in a.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("The {}th element is {}", i + 1, v);
    }
}

output->
The 1th element is 4
The 2th element is 3
The 3th element is 2
The 4th element is 1

changes-> .iter().enumerate() is used to get the data iterated

```
