3. ðŸŒŸ The for in construct can be used to iterate through an Iterator, e.g a range a..b.

```rust
question->
/* fn main() {
    for n in 1..=100 { // modify this line to make the code work
        if n == 100 {
            panic!("NEVER LET THIS RUN")
        }
    }

    println!("Success!");
} */ 

solution code->
fn main() {
    for n in 1..100 {
        if n == 100 {
            panic!("NEVER LET THIS RUN")
        }
    }
} 

output-> Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.64s
     Running `target/debug/playground`
     
modifications-> we do not want n=100 therefore we change from 1..=100 to 1..100

```
