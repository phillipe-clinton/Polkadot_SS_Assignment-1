```rust
question->
/* fn main() {
   let x = 5;
   // Fill the blank
   let p = __;

   println!("the memory address of x is {:p}", p); // One possible output: 0x16fa3ac84
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
   let x = 5;
   let p = &x;

   println!("the memory address of x is {:p}", p); // One possible output: 0x16fa3ac84
}

output-> the memory address of x is 0x7ffce9d1f3dc

changes-> we add &x to get the address of x

```
