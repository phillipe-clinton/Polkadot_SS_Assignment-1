```rust
question->
/* fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    // Add one line below to make a compiler error: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
    // You can't use r1 and r2 at the same time
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello, ");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    // let r2 = &mut s;

    r1.push_str("world");
}

output->
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.85s

changes-> line added: r1.push_str()
