```rust
question->
/* Remove something to make it work
// Don't remove a whole line !
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);

    println!("Success!");
} */

solution code->
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s;
    let r2 = &s;

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);

    println!("Success!");
}

output->
hello, hello
Success!

changes-> aremoved &mut and added &s in r1 and r2

```
